# 2018-SpeedStudy
2018 Speedstudy path

Inspired by @P1xt, I want to tackle my 2018 coding year in kind of a Speedrun style. Starting with his guides here on GitHub, there is a lot of material that I want to, eventually, complete.

But learning to code, as with many other things, is like a way in the forest. You know where you are. You know where you want to go next. But you don't really know the exact path to get to the other side. So, since I will surely find new material as the year progresses, and my interests might grow or divert, I want to keep this list open.

I don't want to finish these lists before the year ends. I just want to always know where I can go next. I don't want to loose time thinking what to do.
